# oeds-crawler-pack

Installable repository for the KIT crawler extensions while upstream OEDS
remains the base project.

This repository is part of the modular OEDS stack. The shared crawler and
database core remains in
[open-energy-data-server](https://github.com/open-energy-data-server/open-energy-data-server),
while deployment, scheduling/UI, and post-processing live in
[oeds-deployment](https://github.com/johannesschuhmacher/oeds-deployment),
[oeds-scheduler-ui](https://github.com/johannesschuhmacher/oeds-scheduler-ui),
and [oeds-post-scripts](https://github.com/johannesschuhmacher/oeds-post-scripts).

## Responsibility

This module contains the KIT-enhanced crawler implementations and their shared
base class `crawler.common.kit_base.KitCrawler`. It does not contain the
scheduler, post-run scripts, or deployment.

The generic parts of `KitCrawler` (per-crawler logging, database URI
handling) are intended for an upstream contribution to OEDS. Until that
contribution is accepted, they are kept here so the published modules work
without the KIT monorepository.

This package exists to prevent functionality loss while improved KIT crawlers
are prepared for upstream OEDS or kept as extension crawlers.

## Current Behavior

- ships all current KIT crawler implementations as importable `crawler.*`
- registers its crawlers as `oeds.crawlers` entry points such as
  `crawler.smard:SmardCrawler` (`oeds-crawl --list` shows them)
- gives KIT crawler specs priority over upstream OEDS when the deployment stack
  merges registries
- keeps upstream-only crawlers available through `oeds-core`

The registry priority is:

```text
oeds-crawler-pack before oeds-core
```

## Base class

`crawler.common.kit_base.KitCrawler` is upstream's `oeds.base_crawler.BaseCrawler`
(engine, `search_path`, `create_schema`) plus the pack's additions: a rotating
file log `logs/<crawler>.log` and rate-limited critical-error mails on the
logger named after the crawler (`crawler.common.crawler_logging`), dotted
config access `self.get("a.b")`, and `set_metadata` with
`concave_hull_geometry`. Constructors take `(crawler_name, config)`; the
`database_uri` config key (ending in `?options=--search_path=`) stays valid,
`kit_db_uri` turns it into the `{DBNAME}` form upstream expects.
Crawlers subclass `KitCrawler` directly; there is no other base-class import
path. Other modules use `crawler.common.local_env` (dotenv, email overrides)
and `crawler.common.runtime_env.resolve_database_uri`.

## Local Development

Install and test this repository directly:

```powershell
uv sync
uv run --with pytest pytest tests
uv run oeds-crawl --list
```

No checkout of `open-energy-data-server-KIT` is required.

## Live Validation

Run credentialed source checks through the deployment repository's
`tools/test_live_crawlers.sh`, not through unit tests. It uses isolated databases
and can exercise both KIT and upstream implementations. See the
[live crawler report](https://github.com/johannesschuhmacher/oeds-deployment/blob/main/docs/crawler-live-tests.md)
for commands, measured results and known failures. Registry availability does
not mean that every remote source is operational.

The package includes the NetCDF backend for Copernicus statistics. EPEX trade
archives use the existing `database_batch_size` setting for CSV processing as
well as database writes. Energy Forecast CSV history follows
`OEDS_CRAWLER_DATA_DIR` (default: `crawler/data`).

MaStR reads the remote ZIP with HTTP range requests. For a small test, set
`tables: [EinheitenWind, Katalogkategorien, Katalogwerte]` and
`max_rows_per_table: 100` in that crawler's configuration. Omit both settings
for the full import. The bounded import is a sample, not a complete register;
repeating it updates matching primary keys without adding duplicates.

GIE keeps AGSI storage columns separate from ALSI LNG columns. The explicit
`lng_*` fields distinguish GWh, thousand cubic metres and GWh/day; raw source
payloads remain available. Existing inventory tables and the latest-inventory
view are upgraded in place. SMARD metadata records actual stored date bounds.

## Policy

No crawler should be removed from the deployable crawler set until it has one of
these documented outcomes:

- merged into upstream OEDS
- kept here as an extension crawler
- replaced by a verified equivalent
- explicitly deprecated

## Out Of Scope

- scheduler UI
- deployment playbooks
- post-run gapfill or forecast pipelines
