# oeds-post-scripts

Post-run processing package of the [oeds-kit](../../README.md) workspace.
Crawler extensions, scheduling/UI and the installation live in
`packages/crawler-pack`, `packages/scheduler` and `deploy/` of the same
repository.

## Responsibility

This module should transform, validate, fill, forecast, or derive data after
crawlers have written source tables.

## Contents

- gapfilling
- price forecasting
- ENTSO-E availability map refresh
- derived SQL refresh tools
- stable `oeds-post` CLI

## Current CLI Facade

Implemented command facade:

```powershell
oeds-post gapfill entsoe-fms
oeds-post refresh entsoe-availability-map
oeds-post forecast day-ahead-price
oeds-post backfill entsoe-unavailability
```

These commands delegate to the included legacy-compatible modules. This
preserves behavior while giving the scheduler a stable command vocabulary.

Command execution resolves the legacy-compatible script root in this order:

1. explicit `--repo-root`
2. `OEDS_POST_REPO_ROOT`
3. current working directory when it contains `scripts/`
4. the installed module location

Direct-call commands retain the current working directory. Only the legacy
subprocess fallback uses the script root. Set `OEDS_CRAWLER_DATA_DIR` to a
writable directory for downloaded files; installed source code can be read-only.

Useful migration helper:

```powershell
oeds-post --from-script scripts/gapfill_timeseries.py
oeds-post --list
oeds-post --migrate-config CRAWLER_CONFIG.yml
oeds-post --migrate-config CRAWLER_CONFIG.yml --output CRAWLER_CONFIG.post.yml
```

Current scheduler config can migrate from:

```yaml
post_run_scripts:
  - "scripts/gapfill_timeseries.py"
```

to:

```yaml
post_run_scripts:
  - "oeds-post gapfill entsoe-fms"
```

For automated migration previews, use:

```python
from oeds_post_scripts.migration import migrate_post_run_scripts
```

## Included Implementation

This package contains the current post-processing implementation:

```text
oeds_gapfill/
oeds_price_forecast/
scripts/
scripts/lib/
```

The stable `oeds-post` commands still keep the legacy-compatible paths as their
behavioral source of truth. Scripts with a safe `main()` entry point can be
called directly in-process; scripts with import-time side effects would run
through the subprocess fallback.
These packages and their SQL files are included in both source distributions
and wheels. The package installs without `oeds-crawler-pack`; the optional
extra `backfill` pulls it in. Database connection overrides
(`OEDS_DB_HOST`, `OEDS_DB_PORT`, `OEDS_DB_PASSWORD`) and the optional
`crawler/.env` file (or the file named by `OEDS_CRAWLER_ENV`) are handled by
`oeds_post_scripts.runtime_env`. Only `oeds-post backfill entsoe-unavailability`
imports the pack's ENTSO-E FMS crawler (extra `backfill`; the deployment image
installs all extras).
Set `OEDS_CRAWLER_CONFIG` when the operational `CRAWLER_CONFIG.yml` is not in
the working directory. The deployment sets this variable to
`/app/CRAWLER_CONFIG.yml` inside its Python containers.
For ENTSO-E backfill downloads, `OEDS_CRAWLER_DATA_DIR` selects the writable
crawler data directory; the modular deployment uses `/app/crawler/data`.

Current direct-call candidates:

| Stable command | Direct mode |
| --- | --- |
| `oeds-post gapfill entsoe-fms` | yes |
| `oeds-post refresh entsoe-availability-map` | yes |
| `oeds-post forecast day-ahead-price` | yes |
| `oeds-post backfill entsoe-unavailability` | yes |

## Local Development

From the repository root:

```powershell
uv sync --all-packages
uv run oeds-post --list
```

Preview config migration:

```powershell
uv run oeds-post --migrate-config .\CRAWLER_CONFIG.yml
```

Preview the command that would run against the module-local implementation:

```powershell
uv run oeds-post --print-command gapfill entsoe-fms
```

## Test Coverage

Run the focused command tests:

```powershell
uv run --package oeds-post-scripts pytest packages/post/tests
```

Database-backed post-processing is covered by `deploy/tools/test_installation.sh`. That suite uses a real
database, deterministic gapfill/forecast cases and actual scheduler post-runs.
Live backfill needs ENTSO-E credentials and an explicitly bounded date range.

## Required Interfaces

- OEDS database schema contract
- post-run command contract
- JSON/log result format for scheduler consumption
